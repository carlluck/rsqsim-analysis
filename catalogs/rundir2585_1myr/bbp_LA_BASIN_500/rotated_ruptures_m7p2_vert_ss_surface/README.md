# Bruce 2585 1myr Rotated Rupture Variability, M7.2 SS

This exercise uses translations and rotations to estimate ground motion variability from different sources. We begin by selecting a subset of similar ruptures which match a set of criteria (in this case, M7.2, Vertical Strike-Slip with Surface Rupture). Each rupture is then reoriented such that its strike (following the Aki & Richards 1980 convention) is 0 degrees (due North, dipping to the right for normal or reverse ruptures). For each site, ruptures are translated such that their scalar seismic moment centroid is directly North of the site, and their 3-dimensional distance (Rrup) is as specified (we consider 3 distance[s] here).

We then  perform various rotations. We rotate the rupture in place around its centroid, holding the site-to-source centroid path and Rrup constant (henceforth 'Rupture Strike'). We also rotate ruptures around the site, holding Rrup and source orientation relative to the site constant but sampling different various paths (henceforth 'Path'). We do this for each unique combination of Rupture Strike, Path, Distance, Site, and Rupture.

*NOTE: This page uses the SCEC BBP to simulate a 1-dimensional velocity structure. Thus we expect no path variability, and plots of path variabilitiy are included only as verification of the method.*

| Quantity | Variations | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Rupture | 100 | Unique (but similar in faulting style and magnitude) ruptures which match the given scenario. |
| Site | 1 | Unique site locations. If 3-d, each will have unique velocity profiles. |

## Source-strike Variability
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

### Source-strike Variability Methodology
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

Source-strike variability, denoted &phi;<sub>s</sub> in Aki & Richards (1980), is computed separately for each:

* Site *[1 unique]*
* Distance *[3 unique]*

Then, for each unique combination of:

* Rupture *[100 unique]*
* Path *[1 unique]*

we compute residuals, &delta;W<sub>es</sub>, of the natural-log ground motions (relative to the median), computed across all 18 combinations of:

* Rupture Strike *[18 unique]*

We take &phi;<sub>s</sub> to be the standard deviation of all residuals, &delta;W<sub>es</sub>, across each combination of Rupture, Path.

We also compute distance-independent &phi;<sub>s</sub>, which is computed as the standard deviation of all residuals, &delta;W<sub>es</sub>, across all distances. Each residual is still computed relative to the log-median ground motion at it's distance.

Here is an exmample with 5 rotations, which would be repeated for each combination of [Rupture, Path]. The site is shown with a blue square, and initially oriented rupture in bold with its hypocenter as a red star and centroid a green circle. Rotations of that rupture are in gray:

#### 20.0 km M7.2 Source-strike Downsampled Results
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

We compute uncertainties on &phi;<sub>s</sub> through downsampling the rotational synthetic data to match the sample sizes used in the ASK 2014 regressions. We search the ASK dataset for ruptures with the same mechanism, magnitude in the range [7.0 7.4], and distance within the range [10.0 30.0] km. We throw out any events with only 1 recording, leaving us with 4 events and a total of 49 recordings. We then downsample our simulated data 100 times, and compute &phi;<sub>s</sub> from each sample. The 95% confidence range from these samples is plotted as a shaded region above, and listed in the table below. Weighted standard deviations are calculated, weighted by the square-root of the number of recordings in each event.

*WARNING: Some real events had more recordings than we have rotations per event, so our dataset for this test is smaller. We are using 2 fewer data points.*

#### All Distances M7.2 Source-strike Downsampled Results

We compute uncertainties on &phi;<sub>s</sub> through downsampling the rotational synthetic data to match the sample sizes used in the ASK 2014 regressions. We search the ASK dataset for ruptures with the same mechanism, magnitude in the range [7.0 7.4], and all distances. We throw out any events with only 1 recording, leaving us with 6 events and a total of 273 recordings. We then downsample our simulated data 100 times, and compute &phi;<sub>s</sub> from each sample. The 95% confidence range from these samples is plotted as a shaded region above, and listed in the table below. Weighted standard deviations are calculated, weighted by the square-root of the number of recordings in each event.

*WARNING: Some real events had more recordings than we have rotations per event, so our dataset for this test is smaller. We are using 289 fewer data points.*

## Within-event, single-site Variability
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

### Within-event, single-site Variability Methodology
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

Within-event, single-site variability, denoted &phi;<sub>SS</sub> in Al Atik (2010), is computed separately for each:

* Site *[1 unique]*
* Distance *[3 unique]*

Then, for each unique combination of:

* Rupture *[100 unique]*

we compute residuals, &delta;W<sub>es</sub>, of the natural-log ground motions (relative to the median), computed across all 18 combinations of:

* Rupture Strike *[18 unique]*
* Path *[1 unique]*

We take &phi;<sub>SS</sub> to be the standard deviation of all residuals, &delta;W<sub>es</sub>, across each combination of Rupture.

We also compute distance-independent &phi;<sub>SS</sub>, which is computed as the standard deviation of all residuals, &delta;W<sub>es</sub>, across all distances. Each residual is still computed relative to the log-median ground motion at it's distance.

Here is an exmample with 5 rotations, which would be repeated for each combination of [Rupture]. The site is shown with a blue square, and initially oriented rupture in bold with its hypocenter as a red star and centroid a green circle. Rotations of that rupture are in gray:

## Between-events Variability
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

### Between-events Variability Methodology
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

Between-events variability, denoted &tau; in Al Atik (2010), is computed separately for each:

* Distance *[3 unique]*

We first compute the median natural-log ground motion, &delta;B<sub>e</sub>, for each combination of:

* Rupture *[100 unique]*

That median, &delta;B<sub>e</sub>, is computed across all 18 combinations of:

* Site *[1 unique]*
* Rupture Strike *[18 unique]*
* Path *[1 unique]*

We take &tau; to be the standard deviation of all &delta;B<sub>e</sub>.

We also compute distance-independent &tau;, which we take to be the mean value across all distances.

Here is an exmample with 5 rotations, which would be repeated for each combination of [Rupture]. The site is shown with a blue square, and initially oriented rupture in bold with its hypocenter as a red star and centroid a green circle. Rotations of that rupture are in gray:

#### 20.0 km M7.2 Between-events Downsampled Results
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

We compute uncertainties on &tau; through downsampling the rotational synthetic data to match the sample sizes used in the ASK 2014 regressions. We search the ASK dataset for ruptures with the same mechanism, magnitude in the range [7.0 7.4], and distance within the range [10.0 30.0] km. We throw out any events with only 1 recording, leaving us with 4 events and a total of 49 recordings. We then downsample our simulated data 100 times, and compute &tau; from each sample. The 95% confidence range from these samples is plotted as a shaded region above, and listed in the table below. Weighted standard deviations are calculated, weighted by the square-root of the number of recordings in each event.

*WARNING: Some real events had more recordings than we have rotations per event, so our dataset for this test is smaller. We are using 2 fewer data points.*

The SCEC broadband platform validation exercise: Methodology for code validation in the context of seismic‐hazard analyses.

The BBP exercise positioned sites in a 'racetrack' around the ruptures. Here, we instead position and rotate the ruptures around the site in order to work in 3-D with CyberShake reciprical calculations. Results for official scenarios and distances are in **bold**, results for additional magnitudes or distances not defined in the Goulet et. al. (2014) are *italicised*.
