# RSQSim Catalog Analysis

| Date | Name | Duration | Element Area | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 2017/10/17 | [Bruce 2320](rundir2320#bruce-2320) | 320,117 yrs | 1.35 km | Backslip loading, less refined geometry, projection fix (but all faults surface breaking), same as rundir2310 but less resolved |
| 2017/10/16 | [Bruce 2310](rundir2310#bruce-2310) | 44,742 yrs | 0.42 km | Backslip loading, more refined geometry, projection fix (but all faults surface breaking) |
| 2017/10/13 | [Bruce 2273](rundir2273#bruce-2273) | 43,190 yrs | 0.42 km | Stress loading, more refined geometry, does not contain projection fix (some location discrepancies are present relative to UCERF3 faults). |
| 2017/09/27 | [U3 1mil Element Test](JG_UCERF3_millionElement#u3-1mil-element-test) | 7,481 yrs | 0.23 km | Test 1 million element catalog on UCERF3 fault system, ~0.25 km^2 trianglar elements |
| 2017/08/31 | [Bruce 2194 Long](rundir2194_long#bruce-2194-long) | 641,547 yrs | 1.34 km | Catalog with decent large event scaling and distribution of sizes while not using any of the enhanced frictional weakening terms. |
